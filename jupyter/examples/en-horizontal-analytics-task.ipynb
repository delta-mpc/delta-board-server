    "* ***Dataset***: In the ```dataset``` method, you can specify the dataset for task. The return value is a dict of which key should be the name of dataset and value should be an instance of ```delta.dataset.DataFrame```; the key of dict should be corresponding to the parameters of the execute method. For detailed explanation of the dataset format, please refer to [this document](https://docs.deltampc.com/network-deployment/prepare-data).\n",
    "* ***Analytics implementation***: We need to implement the analytics process in the execute method. The input parameters should be the same with the keys of returned dict of ```dataset``` method. Now the type of all parameter can only be ```delta.pandas.DataFrame```. ```delta.pandas.DataFrame``` is similar with ```pandas.DataFrame```,  now it support operator ```+,-,*,/,//,%```, and method```all, any, count, sum, mean, std, var, sem```.\n"
