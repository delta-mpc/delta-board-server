    "\n",
    "The next step is to define our horizontal logistic regression task to analyze the data on multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There're several parts in the PPC Task that need to be programmed by the developer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Task Config***: We can make some basis task config in the ```super().__init__()``` method. The configurations involves task name (```name```), minimum client count(```min_clients```), maximum client count(```max_clients```),waiting timeout for calculation (```wait_timeout```)ï¼Œand connection timeout for each step in the procedure(```connection_timeout```).\n",
    "\n",
    "  And we can start the zero-knownledge proof step to verify the convergence of result and the consistence of data after the task is finished. To start the zero-knownledge proof step, we need to set `enable_verify` to True in `super().__init__()` method. And also, we could control the timeout of zero-knownledge proof step by parameter `verify_timeout`. Now the zero-knownledge proof step consumes pretty long time and the default value of `verify_timeout` is 300 second. If timeout error occurs in the the zero-knownledge proof step, we should set `verify_timeout` to a bigger value.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ***We decide to disable the zero-knownledge proof step on online demo system due to the resouce restrictions. You should set `enable_verify` to False on online demo system.***\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Dataset***: In the ```dataset``` method, you can specify the dataset for task. The return value is a dict of which key should be the name of dataset and value should be an instance of ```delta.dataset.DataFrame```; the key of dict should be corresponding to the parameters of the execute method. For detailed explanation of the dataset format, please refer to [this document](https://docs.deltampc.com/network-deployment/prepare-data).\n",
    "* ***Preprocess***: In the ```preprocess```, you need to preprocess the dataset, and finally return the x and y for the task. The input parameters should be the same with the keys of returned dict of ```dataset``` method. The returned x and y can be ```pandas.DataFrame``` or ```numpy.ndarray```, and y should be a 1-D array of data labels.\n",
    "* ***Options***: This method is optional. In the ```option``` method, you can specify some options for the logistic regression. The general options are ```method``` (fit method for logistic regression, only `newton` is available now) and `maxiter` (max iterations for fit). The newton method has some specific options, including `ord` (the norm ord for the gradient), `tol` (the stopping tolerance) and `ridge_factor` (the ridge regression factor for the hessian matrices). All these options have default values. You don't need to implment this method unless you have special needs.\n"
